                fishing areas, as reported in the 2022 Ocean Use Survey. This

                  ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview: to capture the value each fishing sector places
                  on different areas of the EEZ, an Ocean Use Survey was
                  conducted. Individuals identified the sectors they participate
                  in, and were asked to draw the areas they use relative to that
                  sector and assign a value of importance. Individual responses
                  were then combined to produce aggregate heatmaps by sector.
                  This allows the value of areas to be quantified, summed, and
                  compared to one another as more or less valuable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fishing value is then used as a proxy for measuring the
                  potential economic loss to fisheries caused by the creation of
                  protected areas. This report can be used to minimize the
                  potential impact of a plan on a fishery, as well as identify
                  and reduce conflict between conservation objectives and
                  fishing activities. The higher the proportion of value within
                  the plan, the greater the potential impact to the fishery if
                  access or activities are restricted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note, the resulting heatmaps are only representative of the
                  individuals that were surveyed.

                  counted once.
