                  ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview: to capture the value each commercial fishing
                  sector places on different areas of the EEZ, an Ocean Use
                  Survey was conducted. Individuals identified the sectors they
                  participate in, and were asked to draw the areas they use
                  relative to that sector and assign a value of importance.
                  Individual responses were then combined to produce aggregate
                  heatmaps by sector. This allows the value of areas to be
                  quantified, summed, and compared to one another as more or
                  less valuable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fishing value is then used as a proxy for measuring the
                  potential economic loss to fisheries caused by the creation of
                  protected areas. This report can be used to minimize the
                  potential impact of a plan on a fishery, as well as identify
                  and reduce conflict between conservation objectives and
                  fishing activities. The higher the percentage of value within
                  the plan, the greater the potential impact to the fishery if
                  access or activities are restricted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note, the resulting heatmaps are only representative of the
                  individuals that were surveyed.

                  the total fishing value in the overall planning area. If the
                  plan includes multiple areas that overlap, the overlap is only
                  counted once.
